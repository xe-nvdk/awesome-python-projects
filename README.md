# learning-python
Place where I save small programs that I created in the process of learning Python. 

This is not a course of Python, but here, you can find simples (and I hope) and complexs programs that I made in my learning process.

I'm learning Python using this (spanish) [Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvsggKtwbLW1j0d5yaCkRF9Axpdlhsxz).
