# Follow the Money ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=xe-nvdk/follow-the=money)

## What?
<b>Follow the Money</b> is a Python App to store in a InfluxDB bucket information about my income and spending. The main purpose is to track, or how I say, follow the money, and control it.

## Why?

I used [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) for a few years. A few weeks ago, I received an email from them that the [service isn't going to be available anymore to signup customers outside of the US and Canada](https://community.waveapps.com/discussion/9686?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=101479459&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8coP9Eo3giimKQY2_ceF8nNYkHCfFIFTifsagCtkk96xvs_t5RejO_96yRRwRZu6qTCHD0GHvn25Kk0rIfyV0sXNF3xdhPhWkHVZC4c-quUyVgNTI&utm_content=101479459&utm_source=hs_email). 

Still, my current account will be capable of using the service, but they don't know if that will change in the future. 

I take my finance tracking seriously, and I understand this as key for my personal and economic development, so I don't want to depend on a decision that may is taken or not by 3rd parties.

## So?

As part of my process to learn Python, I said, "Why don't you build an app to use and keep tracking money without depends on a 3rd party"?

The idea is basically to create an application to run from a Terminal (I love the Terminal) and ask for a few inputs and then store that data in a database, that DB, is, of course, InfluxDB that will help to graph my income and expenses, not only in a very cool way, but I will also capable to create it alerts to help me stay in budget.

## Why InfluxDB?

I'm in love with Time Series Databases. I work for InfluxData, and lastly, why not?

## Can I use this?

Of course, fork, adapt to your needs, and go ahead.

## Thanks Wave
